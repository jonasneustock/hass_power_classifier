# Agent Memory / Working Agreements

- Keep user-visible docs in sync: update `README.md` and `docs.md` when behavior or structure changes.
- Add changelog-style notes in replies for notable changes; keep them concise.
- Keep diffs focused: avoid unrelated formatting; prefer minimal, clear edits.
- When adding functionality, add or update tests; run `pytest` and report results.
- Respect existing patterns: reuse helpers/routers/modules instead of inlining new logic.
- Validate config impacts: document new env vars; ensure defaults are sane.
- Prefer modularity: new features go into routers/helpers/services, not monolithic files.
- When touching data paths (DB/storage), consider migrations or compatibility; call it out.
- UI changes: reflect in templates and JS; keep Tailwind classes consistent.
- Handle errors defensively; log meaningful warnings; avoid silent failures.
