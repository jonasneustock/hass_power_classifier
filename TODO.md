# TODOs / Next Steps

- [x] Add richer model monitoring: sparkline history of classifier and regression metrics on the Models page.
- [x] Implement automatic hyperparameter search for classifier and regression tree (config toggle).
- [x] Add export/import of labeled segments for sharing/backup.
- [x] Surface activity sensor events on the dashboard timeline.
- [x] Add delete/edit/rename flows for appliances with HA validation.
- [x] Improve diff threshold auto-tuning (adaptive thresholds).
- [x] Implement background retraining schedules (configurable cadence).
- [x] Add automation-friendly API endpoints (retrain, metrics, segments, appliances).
- [x] Expand tests for config/logging/imports.
- [x] Remove proposed value on segment view but keep top-3 predictions.
- [x] Add batch labeling button and flow to jump through unlabeled segments.
- [x] Train models on segment data for all given phases/powerlines (per-sensor diffs).
- [x] Write a blogpost with further enhancement ideas.

New ideas:
- Add UI/API token or auth guard for automation endpoints.
- Offer CSV export/import alongside JSON for segments.
